# mod1
Model a 3D surface and how "water" fills it

## about
### foreword & disclaimer
This is a 42-school project, with the exception that it's not written in C.
This means that the usual rules (a.k.a. [_Norme_](https://github.com/42School/norminette)) don't apply.
In other words, one could say that this in fact isn't a school project, but rather the school just gave the idea for this project.
Some rules have to be followed though, for example the format of the input and the name of the executable.

This is an ambitious attempt to learn both **Haskell**  and learn graphics programming through a project.
I found inspiration and proof that this kind of 3D simulation is doable with a functional programming language from [this short article](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/16wi-cs240h/projects/thong.pdf).


### the program
The binary `mod1` takes 3D coordinates as input, which represent a terrestrial surface.
The coordinates represent the peaks of the hills on the surface.
This means that much of the rendering is left for the author to decide.
For example the slope of the hills or the color scheme for the shader are arbitrary.
